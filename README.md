# ds4-ops (nirecom/ds4-ops)

Running **DeepSeek V4 Flash** via [`antirez/ds4`](https://github.com/antirez/ds4) as a
self-hosted **Claude Code backend**.

- **Server**: Mac (M5 Max, 128 GB) runs `ds4-server` on `:8000`. Speaks both the
  OpenAI and the Anthropic (`/v1/messages`) protocols.
- **Client**: Claude Code on Windows points `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at the Mac.

> This repo holds only the **ops / config / decisions** for using ds4 as a Claude Code
> backend. The engine is the public upstream `antirez/ds4`, cloned separately at `~/git/ds4`
> on the Mac; the local directory here is `ds4-ops` to stay distinct from that clone.

## Docs

Standard layout (mirrors the agents-repo convention):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | What/Why of the design — thinking control, hybrid routing, context-window model |
| [docs/tuning.md](docs/tuning.md) | Parameters — each flag/env var, its value, and why |
| [docs/ops.md](docs/ops.md) | How — run the server/client, monitoring, recovery |
| [docs/history.md](docs/history.md) | Completed work with why — incidents (write storm, sleep freeze) and decisions |
| [docs/infrastructure.md](docs/infrastructure.md) | SSOT for hosts, network, ports, paths |
| [scripts/ds4-start.sh](scripts/ds4-start.sh) | Canonical Mac start script |

## Quick start

**Mac (server):**
```sh
git -C ~/git/ds4 pull                 # update the antirez/ds4 build clone if needed
~/git/ds4-ops/scripts/ds4-start.sh
```

**Windows (client):** set the env in [docs/ops.md](docs/ops.md#client-windows),
then run `claude`.
