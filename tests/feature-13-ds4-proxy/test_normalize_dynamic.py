# L3 gap (what this test suite does NOT catch — explicitly deferred):
# - Real asyncio TLS handshake behavior with mkcert certificates
# - Actual SSE streaming under CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONSTREAMING_FALLBACK=1
# - End-to-end chunked transfer between real client and upstream ds4 server
# - Proxy handler integration (server.py not yet written; auth→normalize→
#     forward→sanitize pipeline tested post-/write-code as L2 integration tests)
# Closest-to-action mitigation: this gap is checked at WORKFLOW_USER_VERIFIED
